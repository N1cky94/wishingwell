### Rules and Guidelines

#### Cooperative rulesets

Cooperative rulesets are basic documents that describe how to work together on this project.
These documents are archived in markdown and can be found in the [Cooperative documentation](documentation/cooperative) folder.

These documents are ordered in specific cases and contain the context of the case, the general aproach to the case. And addition information.

Currently, the following cases are available:
- [C001-git](documentation/cooperative/C001-git.md): How to work with Git in this project.
- [C002-gitHub](documentation/cooperative/C002-gitHub.md): How GitHub is used and implemented in this project.
- [C003-issues](documentation/cooperative/C003-issues.md): How feature requests and bugs are used and implemented in this project.
- [C004-development-installation](documentation/cooperative/C004-development-installation.md): How to install the project for development purposes.

#### Architectural decisions

Architectural decisions are decisions that are made during the development of the project.
These decisions start as investigations and are documented in the [Architectural decisions](documentation/architectural-decisions) folder.

The investigative nature of these documents, means that they are not always correct and or implemented.
You should always read the entire document and pay extra attention to the decision outcome.

Currently, the following decisions are available:

[//]: # (- [AD001-Monolith]&#40;documentation/architectural-decisions/AD001-Monolith.md&#41;: The decision to use a monolith architecture for this project.)
