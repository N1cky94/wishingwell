## Context and Problem Statement

The basic project architecture needs to be decided upon.

## Decision Drivers

The decision is driven by the following constraints on the project:
- Low budget
- Low time
- Low complexity
- Low maintenance
- Easy to deploy
- Easy for beginning developers to understand and contribute

## Concrete Decision

### Option 1: Monolithic Aproach

The code base will be developed in a single project and the same code base.

This will make it easier to deploy and maintain, as there is only one artifact to take in account.
Getting people started is easy as well, as people only need to understand one code base.


### Option 2: Hybrid aproach

## Decision Outcome

Option 1 has been chosen.

### Implementation
